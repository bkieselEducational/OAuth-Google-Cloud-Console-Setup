# OAuth-Google-Cloud-Console-Setup

## Step 1: Create an account

## Step 2: Create a Project.
As you will want to setup a new project everytime that you incorporate Google OAuth into one of your applications, using the name of your application as the Google Project name is probably a straightforward naming convention.

## Step 3: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen
i. Click on the APIs and Services tile depicted above<br>
ii. Then, in the Navbar on the left, click on OAuth Consent Screen.<br>
iii. Once there, you will want to select a "User Type". In our case, we want to select the option "External" and then click the CREATE button below.<br>

<br>
iv. On the following screen (depicted below), we must enter some more data. The first piece of data is our App name. Followed by a User support email (our GCP user email is a fine choice.) and then all the way at the bottom, you will want to enter your Developer contact information (again, probably your GCP user email.). When you've done all of that, click SAVE AND CONTINUE at the bottom.<br>

<br>
v. On the following page Scopes (depicted below), we do not need to make any changes here. We can simply click the SAVE AND CONTINUE button and continue our journey.<br>

<br>
vi. Now on the Test User screen (depicted below) we must authorize a test user who can access the API on behalf of our app. Click the + ADD USERS button, which will open up a sidebar on the right of the screen. Within that sidebar you can now enter the email for your test user (Again, your GCP user is a good candidate!) and then click the SAVE button. If things have gone well, you should see your user's email in the list of Test Users back on the left side of the screen.<br>
