# OAuth-Google-Cloud-Console-Setup

## Step 1: Create an account

## Step 2: Create a Project.
As you will want to setup a new project everytime that you incorporate Google OAuth into one of your applications, using the name of your application as the Google Project name is probably a straightforward naming convention.

## Step 3: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen
i. Click on the APIs and Services tile depicted above<br>
ii. Then, in the Navbar on the left, click on OAuth Consent Screen.<br>
iii. Once there, you will want to select a "User Type". In our case, we want to select the option "External" and then click the CREATE button below.<br>

<br>
iv. On the following screen (depicted below), we must enter some more data. The first piece of data is our App name. Followed by a User support email (our GCP user email is a fine choice.) and then all the way at the bottom, you will want to enter your Developer contact information (again, probably your GCP user email.)<br>
